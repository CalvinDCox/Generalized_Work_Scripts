#This is meant to be run on a smaller batch of computers, for larger queries its recommended to change the If-Then to a log file

#Import CSV containing a list of computers to be modified
Import-Csv -Path "\\Path\To\Computer_List_2-1.csv" | Foreach-Object {

   foreach ($computer in $_.PSObject.Properties) {
   
   #For each computer connect via ADSI
   $LocalComputer = [adsi]"WinNT://$($computer.Value)"
   
   #Then Find the group "Administrators" and fetch ADSI name for "Domain Users"
   $LocalGroup = $LocalComputer.Children.Find('Administrators', 'group')
   $DomainGroup = [adsi]"WinNT://Localdomianserver/Domain Users"
   
   #Remove the desired group from "Administrators" local group
   $LocalGroup.Remove($DomainGroup.Path)

   #This If-Then just gives us visual confirmation that the command ran on the computer
   if($?)
