Purpose
Script to streamline and automate the user creation process at MAPC.

Key Functions
- Create username and give default permissions to users filling out fields like email address, job position, and profile location
- Create email and give MAPC Staff access to the calendar, while also dropping the user-name in the right database
- (Possibly) Appending their email to the CSV file used for Trend automatically

Inputs
- First Name
- Last Name
- Job Title

*Passwords, paths, and usernames should be default or derived from the three above.

Outputs/Results
I should be able to enter the three variables and run the script, then log in with the username/password specified on both email and on the computer. Calendars for new users should immediately be viewable to all staff, and controlled by "Netadmins" in the Email Control Panel
Naturally need a status log for each step it could be as simple as
