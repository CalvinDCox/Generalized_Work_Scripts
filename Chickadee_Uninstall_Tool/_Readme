# Chickadee Uninstall Tool
Small script that let me uninstall programs from one or more computers. 

# Purpose

WMIC Script -
script will pull the computer name and the parts list from user and loop through the commands in the system, saving the output to a list. Building out may include letting users send argumets from multiple computers for the same command. (assuming I have time) Only req is that the computer has to be turned on, and the call for uninstall has to come from an admin account.
